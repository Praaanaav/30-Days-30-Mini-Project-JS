<p id="description">30 Days 30 JavaScript Projects is a personal challenge Iâ€™ve taken to improve and strengthen my JavaScript skills. The idea is simple â€” build one mini project every day for 30 days using only HTML CSS and JavaScript. Each day I pick a small idea â€” like a calculator a to-do list or a music player â€” and bring it to life using JavaScript. These projects help me learn how to use JavaScript in real-world situations like DOM manipulation event handling functions arrays and much more. The goal of this challenge is not just to write code but to build consistency solve problems and become more confident in JavaScript by practicing daily. Every project is kept short and focused so I can complete it in a day and still learn something new. By the end of the 30 days I hope to become faster at writing clean functional code and have a solid collection of JavaScript projects to showcase my progress.</p>
